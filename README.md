# sha256.py
I coded the sha256 algorithm in python without using any modules.

The purpose of the code was to better understand the algorithm and learn how to implement hashing algorithms since there isn't always modules available to use in c++.

This code was written in: nov 14, 2021. I am/was 15 when I wrote this code.
